# SEC487: Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Gathering and Analysis

## Course Syllabus

### SEC487.1: Foundations of OSINT

Overview
We begin with the basics and answer the questions "what is OSINT" and "how do people use it." This first section of this course is about level-setting and ensuring that all students understand the background behind what we do in the OSINT field. We also establish the foundation for the rest of the course by learning how to document findings and set up an OSINT platform. This information taught in this section is a key component for the success of an OSINT analyst because without these concepts and processes in place, researchers can get themselves into serious trouble during assessments by inadvertently alerting their targets or improperly collecting data.

### SEC487.2: Gathering, Searching, and Analyzing OSINT

Overview
OSINT data collection begins in section two after we get a glimpse of some of the fallacies that could influence our conclusions and recommendations. From this point in the course forward, we examine distinct categories of data and think about what it could mean for our investigations. Retrieving data from the Internet could mean using a web browser to view a page or, as we learn in this section, using command line tools, scripts, and helper applications.
